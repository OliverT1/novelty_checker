However, this study did not continue for many generations, and none of the populations died out completely during the observed period (Southwick1955The pages 12-14).\n\nSouthwick's study found that even with unlimited food, population growth was limited by other factors such as high mortality of young mice due to cannibalism and desertion (Southwick1955The pages 10-11).

They found that muscle fibers from high-gain rats were significantly larger in diameter (44.9\u03bc) compared to low-gain rats (38.9\u03bc). Light muscle fibers in high-gain rats were 40% larger than in low-gain rats, while dark fibers were 19% larger (Swatland1972A pages 1-2). The enlarged muscles in these rats were achieved substantially through muscle fiber hypertrophy, particularly of light fibers (Swatland1972A pages 2-4, Swatland1972A pages 4-4).\n\nWhile not focused specifically on muscle mass, other studies have shown that selective breeding can alter body composition and muscle characteristics in rats. For example, rats bred for high endurance capacity showed changes in muscle fiber composition and capillary density (Howlett2009Peripheral pages 1-1). Additionally, selection experiments for body composition traits in rodents have led to positive correlated responses in growth, feed efficiency, and lean body mass (Eisen1989Selection pages 12-14).\n\nThese studies demonstrate that selective breeding can produce rats with increased muscle mass and altered muscle characteristics over multiple generations.", "references": "1.

The review explores various inhibitors of myostatin activity or signaling that could potentially enhance muscle growth in animal agriculture and serve as therapies for muscle-wasting diseases in humans. However, as of the publication date in 2016, there are no commercial myostatin inhibitors available for either agricultural or biomedical purposes. The authors emphasize the need for further research to identify the safest and most effective myostatin inhibitors and administration strategies, which could significantly impact both animal production and medical fields.", "text": {"embedding": null, "text": "", "name": "Chen2016INVITED pages 1-2", "doc": {"embedding": null, "docname": "Chen2016INVITED", "citation": "P.

They created a comprehensive library of VSV-G mutants with His6 tag insertions and used iterative retroviral infections to select functional variants (Yu2006Selection pages 1-2, Yu2006Selection pages 4-5). This approach combines elements of pooled screening and lentiviral vectors to identify infectious glycoprotein mutants.\n\nSalamango et al. created a mutagenized library of MLV Envelope proteins and used retroviral transduction to generate a stable cell library expressing mutant Envelopes. They then screened these mutants in parallel to identify those affecting incorporation and infectivity (Salamango2016In pages 10-13, Salamango2016In pages 4-7). While not explicitly using lentiviral vectors, this method employs a high-throughput, pooled approach to screen for infectious glycoprotein variants.\n\nThese studies demonstrate the use of high-throughput, library-based approaches to identify functional viral glycoprotein mutants, closely aligning with the concept described in the claim.", "references": "1.

The studies reviewed, including those on pomegranate and citrus fruit juices, suggest potential chemopreventive properties but do not claim a cure for cancer. These juices contain compounds like ellagic acid, punicalagin, and flavonoids, which may help reduce cancer risk through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, but they are not cures (Jaganathan2014Role pages 4-5, Jaganathan2014Role pages 6-7, Jaganathan2014Role pages 7-8, Jaganathan2014Role pages 2-3, Jaganathan2014Role pages 5-6).\n\nSimilarly, the research on Morinda citrifolia (noni) fruit indicates potential anticancer activity, but the evidence is insufficient to support its use as a cancer cure. The studies highlight some inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth and potential immune system stimulation, but no human clinical trials have demonstrated that noni juice can reverse cancer (Brown2012Anticancer pages 7-8, Brown2012Anticancer pages 2-3, Brown2012Anticancer pages 8-9, Brown2012Anticancer pages 9-11).\n\nThe compound B-1 from Prunus mume fruit shows inhibitory effects on cancer cells, but it is not claimed to cure cancer (Jeong2006Isolation pages 4-5).

Based on the relevant papers I found, there is substantial evidence demonstrating that amylin increases weight loss. Multiple studies in both animal models and human clinical trials have shown significant weight reduction effects of amylin and its analogues.\n\nIn diet-induced obese (DIO) rats, peripherally administered amylin for 4 weeks reduced body weight by 10-14% at the highest doses tested (hay2015amylinpharmacologyphysiology pages 22-23). Similarly, in obese human subjects, pramlintide (an amylin analog) at doses of 120-360 \u03bcg twice daily resulted in greater weight loss than placebo over 4 weeks (hay2015amylinpharmacologyphysiology pages 25-27).\n\nClinical trials have also shown promising results. A 4-week treatment with pramlintide in overweight and obese humans led to about 5% body weight loss (lutz2010theroleof pages 7-7). Furthermore, when combined with other hormones or peptides, amylin demonstrated enhanced or synergistic effects on reducing food intake and body weight (hay2015amylinpharmacologyphysiology pages 27-28).\n\nMore recent studies have explored novel amylin analogues. For instance, cagrilintide (AM833), a long-acting acylated amylin analogue, showed dose-dependent reduction in food intake and weight loss (dehestani2021amylinasa pages 2-3).

Long-acting agonists, such as albiglutide and liraglutide, provide better glycemic control by maintaining elevated plasma levels, which results in higher fasting insulin levels and greater reductions in HbA1c.

Additionally, ChemCrow's integration of expert-designed tools allowed it to overcome limitations in handling chemistry tasks, further facilitating the discovery of new chemical entities like chromophores (bran2023chemcrow pages 7-9). The successful application of ChemCrow in this context is further supported by its ability to outperform other models in chemical reasoning and factuality, particularly for complex tasks (M.2024Augmenting pages 5-6, bran2023chemcrow pages 4-6).", "references": "1.
